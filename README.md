# TruthChain v1 Demo

This is the original sourcecode for TruthChain: Community Notes for LLMs. The way it works is that the user launches a CLI tool, and makes requests to OpenAPI. OpenAPI simulates answers from a bank of LLMs. The LLMs are assigned a scoring based on their responses to controversial questions. The goal is to provide accountability to LLM outputs. LLMs are increasingly subject to censorship, bias and misinformation. The degree of tampering is likely to increase. The ultimate goal of TruthChain is to develop an information anti-virus that can be used to spot deceptive LLMs. 

Running the code:  
- You will need an OpenAPI key
- Download the source, and run (in terminal) `cargo run` command
- Create a .env in root of project and set `OPENAI_API_KEY=[YOUR KEY]`  

Once you run the CLI, you will be asked to submit a question. You go multiple rounds and can poll the AIs for different questions.
